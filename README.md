## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The objective of this task for me was to learn CSS Grid, as I have always relied on Flexbox until now. I believe I now grasp the basics, thanks to videos by [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob).

### Continued development

In the main resource that I used (linked below), the video ends with grid template areas. I did not use these for this particular challenge as I just wanted to get my head around CSS Grid. However I will look more into this property the next time I use CSS Grid.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell - Learn CSS Grid the easy way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU) - This was the main resource I used. He is doing the same challenge, but I did not use his starter code.
